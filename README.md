### 1. Obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage
Sign up at https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key for a free tier key.
Make sure to save the key for later in the project

### 2. Store API Key as secret in Parameter store
```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name "stock-api-key" --value "<API_KEY>" --type "SecureString"
```

### 3. Run Terraform commands
Initializes the directory
```bash
terraform init 
```
Format your configuration if needed 
```bash
terraform fmt 
```
Validate your configuration
```bash
terraform validate 
```
Apply the configuration and creates infrastructure
```bash
terraform apply
```
Terminates resources created by Terraform
```bash
terraform destroy  
```

### 4. Create subscription for SNS topic and subscribe to it
You can subscribe using email and/or SMS

Here is what a succesful test looks like:

## What was learned 
- Create an SNS topic for users to subscribe too
- Setting up SNS to send messaseges 
- Create AWS services using Terraform
- Retirving data from an api and changing it to a readable format
- Tesing before delpoying your code
- 
## Future Improvements
- Have a link users and click to subsribe 
- Have a way to enter what stocks they want to see outside of changing the code inside the fuction
